Sample codes for pretraining of super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGANs) based on snapshot samples from homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT).

The present framework composed of several pretrained SRGAN models achieves scale-oriented global field reconstructions from coarse flow fields in a zero-shot manner.

The sample codes used for clustering the low-resolution global flow field into subdomains, as well as for pretraining the MLP models to estimate the Taylor microscales embedded in the low-resolution inputs, are also provided.
